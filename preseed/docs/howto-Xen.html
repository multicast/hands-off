  <h1>Hands-Off auto-installer --- Xen installer</h1>

<b>WARNING: Not really working since the switch to Xen3.0</b>

<p>This is currently pretty rough around the edges, so should be
considered more a proof-of-concept than a polished implementation.

<p>That said, it does work with only a couple of moments of user
intervention required to coax it along.

<p>With d-i/xen you can use debian-installer to install a machine running
Xen, then in the domain0 linux instance, you can use debian-installer
to install standard recipes.  This is useful both as a quick way to
get up and running with Xen, and should also prove handy for testing
debian installer setups in an environment where you have the chance to
analyse what's going on as it happens (that will need some more work
on diagnostic tools though, I expect)

<p>The first thing to do is install the Xen machine itself, which is done
by following the instructions in the HOWTO for your chosen boot method,
and then specifying the following at the boot prompt:
<pre>
  boot:  linux26 -/-=xen0
</pre>
This will install a minimal debian, grab the install tarball for xen,
install it, apply various tweaks, and then (unless I work out an easy
way of doing this for you) be ready for you to reboot into Xen for the
first time.

<p>Once you've rebooted, you should find yourself in Domain0, running Linux.

<p>At this point, you can create a new domain and install debian into it.
I've arranged that an LVM device /dev/vg/vm1hda has been created for
you, so you just need to install debian onto it.

<p>The following commands will be in root's bash_history, so just log in
as root, go up 2 lines (Ctrl-P or UpArrow) and then run them in order
(Ctrl-O lets you run a command then step on to the next one in the
history)

<p>First, boot the xen domain, using a tweaked netboot initrd.gz file,
which will cause debian to be installed into the image created above:
<pre>
  xm create -c xm-debinst1-install
</pre>
when that finishes (you'll see a couple of message about xen-br0
entering disabled state) you should be able to get back to a command
line by hitting return twice.

<p>Then you can boot the newly installed system thus:
<pre>
  xm create -c xm-debinst1
</pre>
This then performs the first boot, and leaves you at the boot prompt
of your new domain.

<p>Note: if you were to take a copy of the disk image before doing
the "xm-debinst1" boot, you'd have a system that is in the state just
before its first boot, so you could use this for quickly generating
several domain images, without having to repeat the installation
above.

<hr>

<h3>Notes about the full horror of how I put the initrd image together:</h3>

<p>Xen has a virtual console, which is not properly attached to /dev/tty.
In order to stop it whining about not being able to find the console,
and subsequently deciding that it failed to set the keymap, I've
replaced the binaries for kbd-check & kbd-chooser with a script that
just does "exit 0"

<p>removed /lib/modules/2.6*, and replaced them with most of the modules from
the xenu kernel package that gets installed as part of the xen0 install 

<p>I've also done the same tweaks I generally do to initrd images:
<pre>
  add /lib/debian-installer-startup.d/S35preseed
  add /preseed.cfg
</pre>

<hr>

<p>The xen 2.6.11 kernel was produced by downloading the xen source
tarball, running enough of it to get a patched 2.6.11 kernel tree,
copying the config from a debian package, and then tweaking it till it
worked.  The package was then generated with kernel-package's
make-kpkg.

<p>This should really be re-done, with a useful diff file being
generated, and a properly constructed initrd and set of kernel module
packages generated.  Once done, the module packages should be put
somewhere where the install will find them, perhaps on the xen domain0
installed in the first stage of the install, so that there is no need
to supress complaints during the install with the
anna/no_kernel_modules=true kludge

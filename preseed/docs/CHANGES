dashslashdash is no more.

All it's features are now built into the relevant debian-installer udebs

 -/-     -->  auto-install/classes
 -/url   -->  job now done by preseed/url
 -/host  -->  not really available in the same form.  Might come back.

 dsd/classes --> auto-install/classes

Switched to using the etch version of d-i now that sarge-support.udeb
allows it to install sarge systems

Stop relying on the dsd:// urls and the optional? and substitution| flags
and instead use the newly added preseed/run program download feature

Move to doing as much as possible in the late_script, if possible removing
any install_script, since that should fit in better with the one pass install
from etch

Use /usr/share/dashslashdash/functions.sh to avoid duplication in scripts

Now we're building the images using the debian-installer method

Replace all local/* variables with dsd/* so that the local admin can use
the local/ namespace for whatever they wish

Make the initial dashslashdash.sh script assume that it should
get its files from a release directory, rather than the top level
so hands.com/d-i/dsd becomes svn.hands.com/d-i/tags/0.5/dsd, for example.

Compatibility with older versions of the config files is pretty badly broken
by this and the previous set of changes.

Since earlier versions, we now support executable preseed files, and
look out for /dashslashdash.sh to kick everything off, assuming that
a -/<whatever> kernel commandline parameter specified.

# This file specifies the information to populate a system with some users
# It's mostly intended to allow a system to get setup with the relevant admin(s)
# being able to log in.

#The fields are colon separated:
#  username
#  crypt passwd
#  sudoer
#  gecos
#  ssh key name(s) -- comma separated

# note, you can generate the first two columns with:
#   htpasswd -n -b username password

#root:BLANK:0::phil@palm
root:zvdN3dxoYGn5M:0::admins@customer1,phil@palm
phil:zvdN3dxoYGn5M:1:Philip Hands,,,:phil@palm

# BTW that password is the highly secure "password"
# you might want to change that :-)

This isn't a real partitioning scheme

It's supposed to allow you to specify that you want to do the partitioning
by hand, so you could do:

  boot: install -/-=spdx/firewall;partition/hand

and have everything that spdx/firewall gives you appart from the install
pausing to allow you to do your own partitioning.  I've not tested this
too much, so please don't use it on the assumption that it will protect
the partition with your company's accounting system on it ;-)

Cheers, Phil.

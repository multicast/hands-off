This is a tutorial covering the use of the debian-installer auto-install mode

To give it a go, boot with Lenny's debian-installer, select the Advanced
menu, and then the "Automatic Install" option.

When prompted for a preconfiguration source, enter:

  hands.com

Then when prompted for classes, just accept the default "tutorial"

This is a work in progress -- if you have suggestions for improvement,
they will be gratefully received.

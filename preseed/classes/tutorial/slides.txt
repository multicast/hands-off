{1} {Introduction}
This tutorial is part of the hands-off framework:

This is only one of the many ways of taking advantage of debian-installer's automatic installation capabilities -- for much more information, visit:

{2} {Before you start}
There are a few things you need to decide before seting up for automated installs.

  Do you need to support multiple boot methods, or are you in an
  environment where you know you'll only ever want to boot from USB
  stick (or CD, or via PXE), say.  Deciding to support all methods
  provides much more flexibility, but is a little more effort, and
  needs more testing.

  Do you want to support a wide range of hardware, or site setups,
  or are you happy to limit yourself to supporting a limited set of
  systems in an environment where you control most of the variables?
  If you want to support a wide range of environments and systems,
  you'll want to split your preseed fragments up, so that they can
  be applied differently depending on the details of the install
  in questio.  One the other hand, if you're installing cluster nodes
  on a private network, you probably want a single preseed.cfg file,
  launched with PXE.
{3} {The End}
That's the end of this tutorial.
(a bit short, I know, but this is a proof of concept)

If you continue from this slide, the system will reboot to avoid
touching the disk on your system."

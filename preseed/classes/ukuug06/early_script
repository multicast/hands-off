As you can see, we are in a position to make changes to the running installer, by invoking various hooks that allow scripts or programs to be run.

In the case of this note, it is being displayed though the
'preseed/early_command' hook.

In the \"Hands-off\" preseeding framework, this is achieved by dropping a file 'early_script' in the 'classes/ukuug06' directory, and then ensuring that the ukuug06 class is defined (with 'classes=ukuug06' at the boot: prompt).

Hands-off then takes care of making sure that it gets invoked for you"

"Other opportunities to run scripts d-i are:

  o  During preseeding itself, through the use of the magic 'preseed/run'
     setting.

  o  Just before the reboot, by use of the 'preseed/late_command' hook
     (Hands-Off uses this to implement the running of <class>/late_script)

  o  For 'sarge' installs, we still have a post reboot base-config phase, which
     allows a 'base-config/late_command' script."

"If that's not enough, you can rip d-i's guts out, and replace them with
something you found on a distant planet inside a silicon based lifeform:

  o  various stages through the install perform run-parts type behaviour on
      hook script directories, so dropping a script into one of those directories
      will allow you to take fine control of other stages of the install

  o  installing extra udebs in the early_command will allow you to enhance or
     replace pretty much any aspect of d-i behaviour that your imagination is
     capable of coming up with.

  o  fiddling with the files under /var/lib/dpkg can make unusual things
     happen (but that's almost always very naughty indeed, and if you do it
     you'll have to be spanked ;-)

and all without having to rebuild your boot media."

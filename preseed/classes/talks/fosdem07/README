This is a copy of Frans Pop's presentation for FOSDEM 2007

To give it a go, boot with Etch's debian-installer, and at the boot prompt type:

  boot:  auto url=hands.com classes=talks/fosdem07

Here's his readme for the directory in debian's SVN, which you can find here:

At FOSDEM 2007 I gave a talk on automating installations using preseeding
in Debian Installer. The "slides" of this presentation are displayed as
part of the installation using Philip Hands' "hands-off" framework.

For the presentation I set up a VMWare team consisting of a server running
DNS, DHCP and a webserver (bind9, dhcp3 and boa) and a client which was to
be installed.

server: fosdem1 10.19.50.1
client: fosdem2 10.19.50.2

The directory 'fosdem1' contains the congiguration setup for the server and
the contents of its "website" (the preseeding stuff, a.k.a. the presentation).

The client was installed from an Etch installation DVD and the installer was
booted with 'autogui url=fosdem1 classes=fosdem07'.
